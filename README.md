Why?
- Save on money, time and labor.
- Ensure potable water is being provided to as many communities as possible

It would be much better if the Tanzanian Government was able to focus its time and resources to deliver potable water across all communities in a more efficient manner.
Being able to accurately identify pumps in need of repair or broken pumps would improve efficiency in terms of site visits, labor costs, materials and also be a way of informing communities of where they can find their nearest working pump
